# Welcome to My Instagram Clone Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Instagram clone project! This project aims to replicate some of the key features of Instagram, allowing users to sign up, log in, post content, engage with other users' posts, and more. While it may not have all the functionalities of the real Instagram yet, I'm continuously working on improving and adding new features.
