# Welcome to My Instagram
***

## Task
 What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

I have not problem.
In my project you will see an instagram clone 
and you can use it fully. After registering there,
the main window will open

## Description
 How have you solved the problem?

My biggest problem was with firebase, registration and Upload File and I solved it with Mentor
and the code in my project is very nicely written and you from it
you can fully use and evaluate it.

## Installation
 How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

You can access my project via my netlify link on
my Instagram-clone, if you work through my code, use npm run, npm install, npm run build.
I think you're better off using the link
npm i or npm start

## Usage
 How does it work?
Mainly in this project I used React JS, firebase and other programming language. It works through netlify link.
