 What is the problem And where is the challenge
My Instagram project

Instagram, LLC[6][a] is a photo and video sharing social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. The app 
allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location — via 
geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and 
locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[8]

Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match 
the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging
 features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which
  allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.[8]
