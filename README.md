## Task
I wrote the instagram clone project in react.js.
No more than 1 components per file.
Additionals components will be in src/components/
CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.

## Description
This project is about creating a clone of Instagram.
To do so, you will have resources. You will use ReactJS and Amplify as backend/storing your database.
You are free to implement the schema you want.
You can also be creative on the design. You should still looks "like" instagram.
A little about Instagram (source wikipedia):
Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG or Insta) is an American photo and video sharing social networking service created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.
